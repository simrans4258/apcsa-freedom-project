## Choosing Tool and Project Idea
As with the tradition of SEP goes, we of course have a new Freedom Project to do. However, unlike the previous years, where we were limited by what we were learning in the year, this time Freedom really **is** freedom, as we can do whatever we want for our projects this year with any tool of our choosing. This is great for me, as I've *always* wanted to make my own game, specifically a visual novel, and since I already have some familiarity with Unity thanks to Game Academy, I decided to lean on those two options for my project.

### Planning out the Game
So, for my freedom project, I was actually dead set on making a visual novel for my project, or something like an RPG along with it, as I always wanted to make my own game. I felt like making a RPG visual novel game would be the best choice for me, as I already had an idea of what the story is going to be like. Anyways, while making the actual visual novel itself shouldn't be too bad, as I already have some familiarity with Unity, there's **a lot** more to making a game than just the code, especially for a project like this. Then, when I mentioned the project idea to some of my friends, they *immediately* said that they wanted to help me with things such as the art, music, writing story, etc. I'm very grateful for my friends to help me out, and with that settled, not only with a bunch of weight removed from my shoulders, but also to get started on relearning Unity!

### Relearning Unity
Thanks to the wonderful people at Urban Arts, I ended up learning how to make basic 2D game development on a famous game engine called Unity. I ended up learning a lot of things on Unity, such as making platformers, a Cookie Clicker like game, turn-based RPGs, and even helped make a rhythm game for a team project. Anyways, since it has been a while since I used Unity after the class, but luckily for me, since I moved onto the 3D class, I ended up relearning a couple of things on Unity 2D, such as making players move and interact with objects for example.

According to my [learning log](/tool/learning-log.md), I ended up reviewing a lot of code on my own, as I went back to the previous projects I did on Unity to see what's useful for my project. For example, I ended up re-learning how to make dialogue boxes in Unity as that is the main thing I needed in my project, and I also looked up and saved tutorials that I need for the project. There were **definitely** Unity elements that I have to learn on my own as I wasn't taught in Game Academy, so there's that. I also looked at the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity.com/en-us) to get some help on some of my code. Overall, I had a solid time re-learning and learning more things about Unity, and I'm sticking with it.

## EDP
Currently I'm at the first two steps of the Engineering Design Process, which are step 1, define the problem, and 2, research the problem. Basically the problem here is to make anything for our freedom projects, which is a visual novel game for me. The research is just learning our tool, and for me it's Unity.

## Skills
Of course, while learning my tool, I ended up learning a couple of skills along the way. Here are a few.

### Re-learning things you already know
Considering I technically got a higher advantage as I learned my tool earlier than others, I ended up having to relearn **a lot** of the things I already knew, either because I forgot them or needed to practice some of the coding I did before. It ended up being rather beneficial to me, as I managed to go deeper into the topics I already know, and I learned a lot more thanks to that. My [learning log](/tool/learning-log.md) helped me keep track of what I need to do for my project, so that's quite good!

### Discover more things for the project
I also figured out it would be beneficial for me to learn more stuff about Unity and C# (which is the language Unity uses), as I felt like I needed to learn more for my project as I was making a visual novel, which is something that I hadn't learned in the Summer Game Academy. I ended up looking into and saving a lot of tutorials on how to make visual novels on Unity, and surprisingly some concepts look easy to learn, like making more complex text boxes or scene transitions for example. Of course there's *a lot* to learn when trying to make something like that on Unity, but hey, it's good to learn something new! Overall, I had a good time re-learning Unity and getting started on my project, but I know there's a lot more to go!
