## Choosing Tool and Project Idea
As with the tradition of SEP goes, we of course have a new Freedom Project to do. However, unlike the previous years, where we were limited by what we were learning in the year, this time Freedom really **is** freedom, as we can do whatever we want for our projects this year with any tool of our choosing. This is great for me, as I've *always* wanted to make my own game, specifically a visual novel, and since I already have some familiarity with Unity thanks to Game Academy, I decided to lean on those two options for my project.
### Planning out the Game
So, for my freedom project, I was actually dead set on making a visual novel for my project, or something like an RPG along with it, as I always wanted to make my own game. I felt like making a RPG visual novel game would be the best choice for me, as I already had an idea of what the story is going to be like. Anyways, while making the actual visual novel itself shouldn't be too bad, as I already have some familiarity with Unity, there's **a lot** more to making a game than just the code, especially for a project like this. Then, when I mentioned the project idea to some of my friends, they *immediately* said that they wanted to help me with things such as the art, music, writing story, etc. I'm very grateful for my friends to help me out, and with that settled, not only with a bunch of weight removed from my shoulders, but also to get started on relearning Unity!
